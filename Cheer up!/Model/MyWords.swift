    YOU ARE SO COOL!
    Хани, я очень хочу донести что-то до тебя. Please, now be a good listener, как ты умеешь.
    
    [if you can't or don't want to listen to the audio, here are a few things I've talked about:]
    
    -the way you dance
    Помнишь, как ты танцевал в лагере? I remember just watching you and thinking how damn beautiful you are. You were amazing, honepie.
    I really hope I can see it more often.

    -Your laugh is contagious. It makes everything better.
    You always can cheer anyone up. You always have this power to lighten up the room and make everything better. You are incredible.
    
    -Your stories. About how it was like growing up, what you liked to do, what your dreams were. Who you liked some things, and used to dislike others.
    You are a great storyteller. And I’m happy about getting to know you


    -The way you sing
    I really love you singing to me. I remember you singing to me at the library, in our movie theatre. Or when you were cooking, making smoothie, or singing this stupid song. Your voice is always so comforting.
    And I don’t know how I live without lullabies. It was always so special, so precious. You don’t even imagine how I feel. Remember the story I wrote about our trip to Europe?

    
    “As I lay my head upon the chest, all I can hear is the heartbeat. I immediately feel that the powers are returned but all I want now is to enjoy the moment before falling asleep.
    The familiar melody comes simultaneously with the heartbeat. I cannot be happier because what I hear is the most gentle lullaby that sends me to sleep carefree.”
    
    
    - Your smile when you achieve things. When you’re passionate, when you’re striving for something. When you are into something. When you do what you love.
    Помнишь, когда ты забивал голы в матче за Интер? Мы все так радовались, так болели именно за тебя. И я была так счастлива видеть, что ты радуешься.
    (and I just love seeing you play)
    
    I love the way you talk about things that make you happy.
    When you get excited about something and you get that look in your eyes.

    -Илияс, I want you to bloom and blossom.
    Илияс, пожалуйста, знай, что я очень хочу видеть, как ты занимаешься тем, что любишь. Я хочу чтобы ты был именно тем, кем you're designed to be, and what you want to be.
    
    If anyone deserves to be happy, it’s you.
    
    And I’ll do anything for you.
    
    Я тебя целую.
    -your honey
